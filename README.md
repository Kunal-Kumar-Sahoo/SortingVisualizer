# SORTING-VISUALIZER

## Introduction
The **Sorting-Visualizer** project aims to build a fully-functional visualizing tool for algorithms developed natively for Python programming, <br> 
using Python3 programming language.

## Features
As of now, the project has following functionalities:
- Generate a random shuffled array of 100 elements
- Visualize elements of array in the form of bar graphs
- Offers a selection menu to choose various algorithms
- Offers a selection menu to choose the speed of sorting action
- Graphically show the comparisons made and swapping of elements

## Get Started
Step 1: Open a terminal/git bash <br>
Step 2: Run the following command <br>
```bash
[user@desktop local/path] $ git clone https://github.com/Kunal-Kumar-Sahoo/SortingVisualizer.git
```

Step 3: If you are using any Linux-based distro or macOS, you would need to install Tkinter<br>
- Debian-based distros:
  ```bash
  [user@desktop local/path] $ sudo apt update
  [user@desktop local/path] $ sudo apt install python3-tk
  ```
- Arch-based distros:
  ```bash
  [user@desktop local/path] $ sudo pacman -Sy
  [user@desktop local/path] $ sudo pacman -S tk 
  ```   
- RHEL-based distros:
  ```bash
  [user@desktop local/path] $ sudo dnf update
  [user@desktop local/path] $ sudo dnf install python3-tkinter 
  ```  
- macOS:
  ```zsh
  user@desktop local/path % pip3 install tk
  ```  
  
Step 4: Now run the program <br>
  ```bash
  user@desktop local/path $ python3 src/main.py
  ```
